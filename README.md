How to use it:
as stated in the title, you'll need sfml (C++ edition) in order to use this class, when it comes to using it, it's very simple:
You just need to create a "UIutils" object, and then, you can look at the "create button / slider / ..." methods in order to create them, 
then you just need 2 more things, to update the elements with the method updateElements in the event loop of your sfml project
and then you need to use the display method to, well, display the elements.
